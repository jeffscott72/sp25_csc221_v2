# Assignment 1: Basic Arithmetic

**Objective:** Practice using variables, user input, and arithmetic operations.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a program that prompts the user to input two numbers  (convert to float).
2. Use variables to store the input and perform calculations for:
   - Sum of the two numbers.
   - Difference between the two numbers.
   - Product of the two numbers.
   - Quotient of the two numbers.
3. Print the results in a readable format. 
    
### Example Output:
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Sum: 8.0
Difference: 2.0
Product: 15.0
Quotient: 1.6666666666666667
```
The numbers in the first two lines of the example output reflect user input. The remainder of the output is provied by python program.
